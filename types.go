/*

As a package developer, you can think of it this way: everything with a capital letter is your
public API, while everything with a lower-case letter is for internal use only.
Creating Package

Additionally, we now have comments above each of our exported types. This isnâ€™t just a nice thing, 
this is a rule enforced by most Go static analyzers, and required if we end up using 
a documentation generation tool.
